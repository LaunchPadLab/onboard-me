## Communication

### Gmail

  We use Launchpad Lab gmail accounts for at work email and calendar, dev logins, and anything else work related, which we store on LaunchPad Lab's Google Drive. You should receive your login credentials on the first day.

  *Pro tip:*  Add a "+ {any text here}" before the host in your email account, e.g., "dev+1@launchpadlab.com" for seed data, to receive all emails as you develop the app.

### Slack

  We use Slack *constantly*. Slack has many channels, each with a specific purpose:

  - #launchpadlab: discuss things that interest everyone. You should be in this room whenever you are working.

  - #lunch_n_learn: volunteer or propose topics ideas to be presented every Wednesday for lunch. Topics can be technical, design, or anything you feel is worth sharing.

  - #opex: short for Operational Excellence. Discuss ideas and updates relating to the opex effort.

  - #space: share or discuss any non-client work.

  - #books: what're you reading these days? Share good reads with your peeps!

  - #shopping_list: we like having snacks around in the office, this channel helps narrow down what we want before ordering.

  - #todays-track: what're you listening to? Share all your groovy tracks!

  Lastly, you will be included in your client project's slack channel.

### Basecamp

  Basecamp is the primary tool we use to communicate with your clients. We strive to utilize Basecamp message and threads over emails with clients to make sure everyone on the team can see messages back and forth throughout the project.

  We also use Basecamp's To-do lists to keep track of QA observations, and feature requests that come up during the project. Lastly, we use Basecamp for our weekly Internal Project Management notes, which internally provide the team's status on the project, and are not shared with the client.

## Project Management

### JIRA

  Most of our client projects use JIRA sprints for project management. If you don't already have a JIRA account, you can log in using your Launchpad Lab email. Your onboarding helper should assist getting you access to the sprints you need. You should have access to JIRA for your client project and potentially several internal projects.

### Trello

  Some of our internal or personal projects use Trello boards for project management. If you don't already have a Trello account, you can make one using your Launchpad Lab email. If there are client projects using Trello boards, your onboarding helper should assist getting you access to them.

### Harvest / Forecast

  We use Harvest in conjunction with Forecast to plan our project hours for each week, as well as keeping track of billable hours. You should be able to login with your Launchpad Lab email.

  NOTE: The Harvest native app is a great utility and integrates with JIRA - allowing you to start timers based on JIRA tickets. Highly recommended.

## Development

### Github

  Your GitHub account should have access to private Launchpad Lab repositories such as our opex projects. You should also have access to your client project. Work with your onboarding member if you do not have access.

### Heroku

  We host our client apps on Heroku. You will create a (separate) Heroku account with your LaunchPad Lab email, and be invited to your client's apps.

### Codeship

  We use codeship on every project as our continuous integration tool to run all of our tests and other build checks an app requires. We integrate Codeship with Github and run it when PR's are submitted, or the master branch is deployed to Heroku.
  You should be able to create an account with your LaunchPad email.

### Sentry

  We use Sentry on all our projects to capture error logging. Sentry is setup in each application to notify project members of errors in any environment Sentry is configured for. You should be able to create an account with your LaunchPad email.

### Invision

  Designers primarily build mock ups in Invision, but all team members will be using this application to review mockups with the client, and as a reference point throughout development. You should be able to create an account with your LaunchPad email and be invited to client projects.
