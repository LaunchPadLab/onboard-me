# Welcome to Launchpad Lab

  We're excited to have you here. This packet contains information that past hires have found helpful.

  We recommend looking through it now and referring back to it later.
  Think of this packet as your Hitchhiker's Guide during your onboarding.

  Feel free to file a pull request to improve any aspect of it, no matter how tiny.

# About Launchpad Lab

  We have one predominate goal: build high quality, high impact digital products. Our interests lie in innovation, building custom software to address unique business needs.

  We value a culture of vulnerability and respect. Being vulnerable is to be honest with each other and our clients; it is the 'secret ingredient' in building relationships that last; see [Getting Naked](#getting-naked).

  By the numbers, we are:
  - 1 product consultant
  - 2 designers
  - 3 sales/business consultants
  - 8 developers

# The Plan

  Your first couple months will most likely be spent learning. Depending on what role you're assuming (Junior, Senior), you may or may not be expected to engage in client work rather quickly.

  Either way your onboarding guide is there to answer questions, pair with, and walk you through the acclimation process.

## How Am I Doing?

  You can expect to meet each week to talk through your progress, goals, and upcoming deliveries for the week - typically on Monday.

  You are encouraged to create a list of major goals to be completed while onboarding, as well a weekly set of smaller, specific goals.

  Generally, THE goal is to become acclimated to the team and your client project. Additionally, we welcome and encourage contribution to any of our internal projects and initiatives.

## How we work

  In your first few months, we ask that you come to the office everyday. This will help us help you hit the ground running. More importantly, we'll get to know you better!

  As an office, we prefer to work on site but are fast and loose with WFM (work from home); meaning, if you need to WFM just let us know over slack. Similarly, if you are sick let it be known (you: not feeling well today, WFM!).

  Developers and designers alike will try to meet a minimum of 30 hours billable on client projects (6 hours/day).
  You should also feel free to set some time aside for personal development, around 10 hours per week; whatever peaks your interest.

  There is a kitchen at the office for all your lunch needs, and we like to keep snacks around for everyone.

## Self-guided Learning

  Whenever appropriate or applicable to your work, you should take time away from client work to do some self-guided learning. This can include reading material from books, attending workshops, or learning about and trying out a technique or library.

## Pairing During the Week

  You will work with your guide on a client project throughout the week, sitting in on meetings and internal discussions. Your guide with pair with you during the week as you work on features.

  Pairing is the fastest and most effective way to learn, so it should be a priority for you and your guide. However, do not expect to pair 100% of the time.

  We also encourage you to pair with other members of the team (designer/developer). Everyone on the team loves teaching and learning, and they'd love to teach and learn from you. A good way to do it is to reach out on Slack that you're looking for someone to pair with, and if people have free time, they'll let you know.

## Site Profile

  Remind us to get a nice in-office portrait of you, to proudly display on our website.

# SPACE & Demo Day

  We value SPACE. SPACE is an internal process for product ideation, personal or otherwise - it is our 'dream' engine. We feel that having SPACE is important, as it provides a creative outlet outside of client work where we can explore and test new ideas.

  Demo Day is your day to share what you've been working on outside of client work. The primary focus is on applications or libraries in the SPACE program, or OpEx milestone achievements.

  Speak to Paul to learn more about SPACE and demo day.

# Getting Naked

  It is tradition at LPL to read a certain book - *Getting Naked* by Patrick Lencioni - when you join the team.

  Why? Through fable, *Getting Naked* explores the value and importance of being *vulnerable*. We feel this is an important lesson in working together effectively, and providing the most impact to our clients.

  *Getting Naked* is a short book (roughly 213 pages), so it should only take you a couple hours to finish - you can find it on the library shelf. You should also expect a lunch invitation from Tom Cullen to discuss the book after you've read it.

# Lunch and Learn

  We encourage learning. Each Wendesday we congregate for Lunch and Learn to hear a fellow collegue present a topic of interest.

  The topic can be client related lessons, a personal project, or reflections on a conference recently attended; really, anything of interest that you feel is worth sharing.

# Blog Posts

  In support of sharing things we've learned or accomplished, we rotate blog posts duties among the team every week.

  What you write about for your week is completely up to you. You can talk about a new technology you're exploring, a gem you wrote for LaunchPad, or lessons learned from a tricky client project.

# Improve the Onboarding Experience

  We encourage you to propose changes to the onboaring process, and anything else that you think could be better. Everyone at Launchpad Lab is constantly trying to do a better job and we welcome feedback.

  As an new employee, you have much better insight into what could make the process better for you than does someone who's been working here for five years.

  Feedback is always, always appreciated on everything at Launchpad Lab. If you have feedback on the overall onboaring experience, please discuss the issue with a team member, or open an issue on this repository.
