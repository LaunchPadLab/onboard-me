# Employee Onboarding Resource

This is the onboarding resource for new LPL employees. 
It should be given to them on their first day.

## So You're Onboarding a New LPL'er

Great! Here's how to use this:

 - Refer our new LPL'er to this repository
 - Make sure they know we'd love feedback on this content
 - Encourage our LPL'er to read through as a reference, i.e. how you might read a dictionary.
